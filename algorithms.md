# My Favorite Resources: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Patterns

I've tried quite a few resources on learning data structures and algorithms (DSA). Here is a list I've put together so you spend less time searching and more time studying.

## What I look for ‚úîÔ∏è
- Clear explanations, ideally in video format.
- Teaches the fundamentals by covering DSA theory.
- Has a roadmap of which topics to start with and how to progress. 
- The problems are in an intentional order. For example, the course should start with easy questions and progress to more difficult ones.

## [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) üöÄ
- The Algorithms Beginner Course is a great, quick introduction to the fundamentals. The recommended problems are good, too.
- Contains the Blind 75 list, as well as its own Neetcode 150 list which has a more well-rounded list of problems.
- Use the Roadmap section to see which order to study the topics.

## [The Roadmap: YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rhT3P1MDHk&list=PLkZYeFmDuaN2-KUIv-mvbjfKszIGJ4FaY) üöô
- Excellent introduction to different data structures, and how to implement them from scratch in JavaScript. 

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) üíª
- The king of DSA sites. It has an excellent list of questions asked in interviews.
- You can use the sort feature to sort questions from Easy to Hard, and even by how often they appear in interviews.
- The downside is that the questions are not in an intentional order, so I use a site like Neetcode to learn the topic and pattern first and do the chapter problems on Leetcode.

## [Work on Communication: Learn REACTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIR_rxusO8Q) üó£Ô∏è
- The sites I listed are great, but there's one key thing missing. There's no opportunity to communicate. To pass interviews, communication is extremely important.
- The best video I've found is from David Yang, where he explains the REACTO framework.
- REACTO: Repeat, Examples, Approach, Code, Test, Optimize.
- Notice that a lot of clarification and discussion happens before the first line of code is written!
- The best tip I can give is to explain your code line by line as you're solving the problem. Also, share your thoughts when thinking. This will avoid awkward silences.

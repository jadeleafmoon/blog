## The Power of Pair Programming: How I Leveled Up My Communication Skills

Pair Programming is a powerful technique used to develop communication skills in a very short amount of time. Plus, it‚Äôs fun!

As a Technical Interviewer at Code Chrysalis, I get to see a wide range of candidates applying to the Immersive Program. One notable difference between applicants I notice is their ability to communicate. Some are very quiet, while others voice their thoughts and explain their code with ease.
I remember my own technical check-in. It felt so awkward because I was in the early learning stages and couldn‚Äôt solve any of the problems.

Not only that but I wasn‚Äôt used to talking about my code. My brain was stuck like a car from the 1900s, puffing black smoke and struggling to start. 

Eventually, I did pass, and when I graduated from the Immersive Program, expressing my technical thoughts became a breeze. I credit Pair Programming for a big part of the transformation.

### Problem: The Lonely Road üíª
Like many on the self-taught journey, I started programming mostly on my own. I was studying alone, thinking alone, and coding alone.

No wonder I had difficulty explaining my code! It was all stuck in my head. My ability to code was improving, but I wasn‚Äôt developing my communication skills.

Why is communication important in the first place? Isn‚Äôt being a good programmer good enough?

Communication is important because we don‚Äôt work alone. We collaborate with others on a team. Great products are made with the combined effort of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of people.
Is it possible to improve communication skills quickly?

Definitely. I didn‚Äôt realize it when I was a student, but I see the answer clearly now. I have witnessed Pair Programming work as a fantastic technique to improve one‚Äôs communication ability in a very short amount of time.

### Solution: Pair Programming to the Rescue üñ•Ô∏è üë®‚Äçü¶± üë©‚Äçü¶±
Pair Programming is a practice where two programmers work together. There are a few variations, and here is how it‚Äôs done at Code Chrysalis:
One person is a Driver, and the other is a Navigator. 
The Navigator codes by verbally giving instructions, while the Driver types the code.
After twenty minutes or so, the partners switch roles.

It‚Äôs like being in a car where the passenger gives directions to the driver. Similar to how a passenger does not touch the wheel, the Navigator in a Pair Programming session in this version does not touch the mouse and keyboard. Everything is relayed verbally. The Driver observes, acts as a sounding board, and may provide the occasional hint when requested, though typically gives full control to the Navigator for the twenty minutes.

‚ÄúWait, why do I have to tell someone to type?! It‚Äôs way faster to do it myself!‚Äù

I know, it seems strange! Yet, I‚Äôve seen this one system transform my classmates into great communicators in a matter of weeks. We made the transition from being solo players to team players.

Not only that, but it was fun!

We did Pair Programming sessions daily. The first week was awkward, for sure. During the second week, I got used to them. By the end of the third week, I started enjoying them. When I graduated, I missed them.
By the end of the Immersive Program, it was a breeze to express technical thoughts. It wasn‚Äôt just me, but I saw all of my classmates improve significantly, especially those for whom English was their second language! 

### The Pros of Pair Programming üôå
How did Pair Programming help? Doing the sessions accomplished several things at once.

**1. Daily Communication Practice**

The process forced me to share my thoughts out loud with another person every day. Code was no longer swimming in my head but was out in the open. Since someone else was typing, I had to learn how to give very clear instructions. Furthermore, I had to explain my steps in a way my partner would understand.

**2. Building Collaboration and People Skills**

It allowed for better collaboration by developing these areas:
- **Trust:** The Navigator couldn‚Äôt touch the keyboard. It was the literal and metaphorical act of letting go. Each person trusted the other to do their part.
- **Patience:** When I was the Driver, I had to restrict myself. The temptation was real! ‚ÄúOmg, I see the solution!!! All they need to do is X.‚Äù However, it was important to not rob my teammate of the opportunity to learn.
- **Equal Time:** Instead of one person dominating most of the session, the roles switched every twenty minutes which allowed each member to practice and contribute.
- **Team Awareness:** Since there was constant open communication, I could see where my partner was heading, or what exactly they were stuck on. This awareness allowed me to provide the right hints to nudge my partner forward.

**3. Better Problem-Solving**

Issues were easier to spot, as one person had a bird‚Äôs-eye view.

**4. Sharing of Knowledge**

I learned from my classmates just by watching them code and seeing their style. To this day, I still remember a particular technique my partner used to solve recursion problems.

**5. Improving Technical Interviewing Skills**
The skills practiced daily in these sessions are skills that interviewers are looking for during technical interviews when job hunting. These skills include engaging with the interviewer, voicing your thought process, and being able to explain your code line by line.

### Building Stats üí™

I get it. Seeing words like Trust and Patience instantly reminds me of my mother‚Äôs favorite Astrology site. Yet, these are real skills that can be built over time and impact an engineer‚Äôs career.

I like to imagine a character in a video game. Let‚Äôs call it Coding Quest. The character has stats like Coding, Communication, and Trust. Doing a Coding session adds points to Coding. On the other hand, doing a Pair Programming session adds points to all three. Imagine doing it daily. The stats start to go up quickly. 
Now, instead of a character in a game, it was my classmates and I that experienced the improvement!

I‚Äôll end with a final example, a scene from Dragon Ball Z. Goku was flying in a spaceship to another planet and had six days to train before fighting a powerful enemy. So what did he do? In that spaceship, he trained under 100 times normal gravity. By the end of Day 6, he became pretty strong.
Like training in that spaceship, I see Pair Programming as a great mechanism to boost one‚Äôs communication skills in a short amount of time.
